## 1. Iterations

### Binary Gap

Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.

## 2. Arrays

### Odd Occurrences In Array

Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.

## 3. Time Complexity

### Perm Missing Elem

Find the missing element in a given permutation.

### Frog Jmp

Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.

### Tape Equilibrium

Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.

## 4. Counting Elements

### Missing Integer

Find the minimal positive integer not occurring in a given sequence.

### Frog River One

Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.

### Perm Check

Check whether array A is a permutation.

### Max Counters

Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum.
